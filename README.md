# DataCamp Course Certificates

* **Data Analyst with Python** - In this track, I learned how to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize data. Through interactive exercises, I got hands-on with some of the most popular Python libraries, including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and many more. I gained experienced of working with real-world datasets, including data from the Titanic and from Twitter's streaming API, to grow my data manipulation and exploratory data analysis skills, before moving on to learn SQL skills necessary to query data from databases and join tables.
