# DataCamp Course Certificates

* **Data Analyst with Python** - In this track, I learned how to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize data. Through interactive exercises, I got hands-on with some of the most popular Python libraries, including pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and many more. I gained experienced of working with real-world datasets, including data from the Titanic and from Twitter's streaming API, to grow my data manipulation and exploratory data analysis skills, before moving on to learn SQL skills necessary to query data from databases and join tables.

* **Data Analyst with R** - In this track, I learned how to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize data in R. Through interactive exercises, I got hands-on with some of the most popular R packages, including ggplot2 and tidyverse packages like dplyr and readr. I also developed my data manipulation and exploratory data analysis skills by working with a wide range of real-world datasets, including everything from Australian population figures to Netflix films. I then gain the SQL skills necessary to query data from databases and join tables.
